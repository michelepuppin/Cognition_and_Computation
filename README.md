# Artificial Intelligence: limits of Deep Learning approaches and ideas toward a human-like intelligence

In this essay I will present the paper Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal authored
by Marcus (2018) to summarize the challenges that Deep Learning approaches are facing
nowadays. I will briefly introduce Artificial Neural Networks architectures functioning
and I will highlight the limiting aspects of this technology. Then, I will present the
paper Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People authored by Lake et al. (2016) to briefly introduce some ideas to combine the strengths of recent Neural Network
advances with more structured cognitive models to aim to a human-like intelligence.
